            I'm a Data Analytics graduate from Bellevue College with hands-on
            experience in operations, technical support, and customer-facing retail.
            I've worked in fast-paced environments where accuracy, reliability, and
            communication matter, from managing complex workflows to leading and
            training team members. I'm especially interested in how data,
            technology, and business come together to improve everyday operations.
